Out of 11 million receptors, sight takes up the most — 10 million. The good thing is that you can create an environment where you see what you want to see.\n\nYou can use strategies that encourage bad habits to promote good ones. You are more likely to form a habit when there are multiple triggers in your surroundings.\n\nScientists have found that people with high self-control have designed their lives to avoid cues that may make them lose control.\n\nRearrange your environment to produce the results you seek in your life."

            "text": "The brain response to enticing opportunities is immediate\n\nThe change in dopamine levels indicates the second a longing appears. Dopamine is vital to habit formation. Most addictive substances release a high dose of dopamine.\n\nHence, they are challenging to break.\n\nRegular activities like drinking water, having sex, and eating also release dopamine.\n\nThe anticipation of a reward has a stronger hold on the brain than the reward itself. It is this feeling that elicits every action.\n\nDoing something you love, along with a habit you want to build, makes it more attractive. This is a process known as temptation bundling. Temptation bundling is an application of Premack's Principle, which states that highly enjoyable activities can be used to reinforce less appealing but essential behaviors. For example, only watching your favorite TV show when you're exercising or visiting your favorite café when you're studying."

            "text": "Habits change when you commit to making a 1% improvement daily over an extended time. Like atoms, these improvements stack up to form a whole organism. Thus, focus on creating systems that enable you to stack up these atoms. Focusing on systems ensures that you continue to improve after reaching specific goals or milestones you have set for yourself.\n\nBefore something becomes a cue, it needs to be assigned a meaning. If you do not become aware of a cue, it will be impossible to crave it. Contentment with your current situation is the key to happiness. Happiness disappears the moment a new desire comes along. We long for the representation of pleasure created in our minds.\n\nThe driving force of behavior is desire. If you nurture a desire for the needed habit, you will maintain it. Emotions drive action.\n\nLogical reasons are not as powerful as emotions when doing something, and cravine comes before a response."
